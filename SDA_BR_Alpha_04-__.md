**Sea Dragon Adventures Basic Rules \- Alpha 04-?? (0.1.0 \- 2025\)**

**(?? in the title will be filled in when this alpha rule 0.1.0 is completed)**

Alpha Version 0.1.0, merging the 5 class system and the 3 class system

**Players: Adventurers and Game Master**

*Sea Dragon Adventures* can be played by any group of players larger than 2 but is best played with 3-6 players in total. 

All but one of the players will be **adventurers.** They will take on the role of fictitious characters that they invent and will take these characters on adventures. 

The remaining player will be the **game master** (GM). It is the GM’s job to tell a story with which the adventurers can interact.

**Character Generation**

Each adventurer will take on the role of a **player character** (PC). A PC may be created using the following steps.

**Step 1: Roll Statistics**

Each adventurer has three statistics, representing the following qualities.

●           	Strength (STR) – Fighting, fortitude, and toughness.

●       	Intelligence (INT)– Spell attacks, knowledge, and perception.

●           	Athletics (ATH) \- Speed, initiative, reflexes.

 To roll statistics, roll **4d6** three times and **discard the lowest roll each time**. The adventurer can assign the four rolls to **STR, INT, ATH** in any order the player wants.

 *Optional Rules:*    

●           	If the GM wants to give adventurers more control over their character, they may allow adventurers to assign each roll to a statistic of the player’s choice.

●           	If the GM wants the game to be more challenging and PCs to be less powerful, they may only allow adventurers to roll 3d6 or make the adventurer not able to assign the rolls to and go in the order of STR, INT, and ATH. 

The adventurer will have a modifier to the stat category according to the following table:

| Score | Modifier |
| :---: | :---: |
| 1 | \-5 |
| 2-3 | \-4 |
| 4-5 | \-3 |
| 6-7 | \-2 |
| 8-9 | \-1 |
| 10-11 | 0 |
| 12-13 | \+1 |
| 14-15 | \+2 |

 

| Score | Modifier |
| ----: | ----: |
| 16-17 | \+3 |
| 18-19 | \+4 |
| 20-21 | \+5 |
| 22-23 | \+6 |
| 24-25 | \+7 |
| 26-27 | \+8 |
| 28-29 | \+9 |
| 30 | \+10 |

 

 

 

 


**Step 2: Choose a Class**

Your character’s *class* represents their occupation within the worlds of Sea Dragon Adventures. Each class determines their starting health, their starting armor and weapon, as well as a special ability unique to each class. Each class also has one or more **recommended statistics.** If your character has a high number in those statistics, then it is recommended you take that class\!

**Now, you’ve finished your character creation, and you can head off for an epic journey in Sea Dragons Adventures\!** 

**Combat**

During combat, the GM should make sure everyone follows the procedures in this section:

**Step 1: Determine the turn order:** Player character will roll, make all make a STR check and then add up all the STR checks. This is called the **Initiative Roll.** If the initiative roll is higher or equal to the monster’s **initiative constant \* number of players** go first, or else monsters go first. If there are different species of monsters, the GM should decide which species’ initiative the monsters should use according to the game’s difficulty.

**Step 2: Taking Turns:**

●           	Monster’s turn: Monsters will go in the order of farthest from PC to closest to a PC. Each monster will do an action and pass their turn.

●           	Player’s turn: Players will go in the order of Wizard, Fighter, and Healer. Each player will have a maximum of 1 minute to make their move, which involves 1 action.

**Step 3: Performing an attack:**

●           	Melee Attack: The adventurer will have to use their movement (30ft each) to move up to the monster and roll for the weapons’ attack. The adventurer will **subtract the amount of damage rolled from the enemy’s armor and deal the remaining damage**.

●       	Spell Attack: This type of attack will ignore any armor that doesn't have magical-resistance immunity. The spell caster will use their action casting **one spell from their spellbook**.

**Step 4: Battlefield Random Encounters: (Optional)**

To make the game more challenging, the GM can add random battlefield encounters during a fight after every player and every monster has taken their turn.

**Ability Checks and Saving Throws:**

When PCs are required to do an **Saving Throw**, they will have to roll 1d20 and add their respective modifiers (stated by the GM). When PCs are required to do an **Ability Check**, they will have to roll 1d20 and add their respective modifiers (stated by the GM), to succeed, they have to get higher than the difficulty class that is set by the GM. (Difficulty class can be announced or not announced by the GM)

 **Spell Saves:**

Each wizard has a **Spell Casting DC**, which is equal to their Intelligence score. When a spell that he/she casts requires a saving throw, the target rolls 1d20 and adds their respective modifiers (stated in each spell).

**To be Considered:**

1. Fighting Styles for Fighters  
2.
